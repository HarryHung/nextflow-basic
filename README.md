# Basic Nextflow Practical Test

This repository contains a working Bash script "pipeline" (`bash_script_pipeline.sh`) and a scaffold of a Nextflow pipeline (`main.nf`). Try to complete the Nextflow pipeline based on the Bash script!

Feel free to use the included Nextflow executable (`nextflow`) to run your Nextflow pipeline:
```
./nextflow run main.nf
```
